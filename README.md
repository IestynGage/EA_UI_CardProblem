# EA_UI_CardProblem
Evolutionary algorithm with User Interface for the card problem.

This purpose of this project is to create a Evolutionary algoirthm for the 'Card Problem'.
Unlike my previous project with Evolutionary algorithm this will be linked to JavaFX to display
information graphically. It will also allow the user to set the starting parameters for the 
Evolutionary algorithm.

# What is Card Problem?

The card problem is where there are ten cards labelled 1-10, all the cards must be sorted 
into two different; Pile 0 and Pile 1. All of the cards in pile 0 are multiplied together. 
Whilst all of the cards in pile 1 are added together. To solution to this problem must 
have pile 0 to be a number of 360 and pile 0 to be the number of 36.
